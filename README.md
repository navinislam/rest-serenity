# rest-serenity
Rest Assured with Serenity Project
The easy way:

### In Terminal:
``` 
Change directory (cd) into the directory containing the project ie: rest-serenity
```

```
To run all tests, run the following command: mvn clean verify serenity:aggregate
```




You will see the results in the terminal.

Additionally you can also find a nice report once the tests have finished running.

To access the reports after the tests have completely finished:
```
A folder called "target" should populate in the directory, open that folder
```
```
Open folder called "site"
```
```
Open folder called "serenity"
```
```
Open index.html in any browser you like 
```
